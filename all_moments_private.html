<p >Lectionary 173 is a project by Robert Crosbie, the Irish musician behind Geisha (now known as Ganjee), who is already known for his authentic, experimental, and organic style. First releasing the "Pegasus Tornado" EP on our label, followed by the music gem "The Delirium Introduction" almost a year ago, now we release "All Moments Are Happening All The Time" by Lectionary 173, which shows a more radical ambient side.</p>


<p >An intimate project revealing once again the depth of Robert's talent and versatility, this album is deep and mysterious, but at the same time soft and calm sounds are allowed to flourish. Featuring elongated strings sustained to the heavens, with experimental sounds that refer to the Geisha / Ganjee style, constant and melodic notes come and go as if it were a deep ocean where anything violent, dramatic, faint or significant can occur in sync.</p>

<p >The ten tracks that make up this album could be a great ambient version of Boards of Canada’s "Tomorrow's Harvest", though "All Moments Are Happening..." goes deeper, and further to create an infinite sound. This album should be mandatory for those who like to explore expansive music and therefore requires repeated playing, over and over. </p>

<p >Listening to "All Moments Are Happening All The Time" ensures a rewarding experience every time. It’s a universe full of dazzling sound phenomena, to compare with the best landscapes or the most beautiful moments of life.</p>
<p>Release Date: 27.10.2016<br>
Catalog number: TBM005</p>
<p>All tracks written and produced by Robert Crosbie.</p>
