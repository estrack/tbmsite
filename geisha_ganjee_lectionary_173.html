Geisha is an electronic music act from Dublin, Ireland. Formed by Robert Crosbie, best known for his work with Dublin indie act The Riot Tapes, debut album "The Sounds Of Geisha" was released in 2007. That album featured slow, ambient, mostly beat-less music; very much inspired by the works of Brian Eno and Susumu Yokota. In 2009 Robert linked up with occasional collaborator Paul Meehan, and the two began creating sounds together and co-writing new material.</p>
 
<p>In 2013 Geisha released "Further / Closer" on Psychonavigation Records. A bold step forward from the debut, this album appealed to lovers of both downtempo electronica and experimental music. "Further / Closer" received national airplay in Ireland and was voted #28 on Red Bull Music's "Top 50 Irish Albums of 2013" poll. </p>

<p>March 2015 saw the release of a new EP, "19,000 Objects". This EP contains music that was begun in 2011 as well as more recent works. These tracks developed the mood and style of "Further / Closer", and featured deep bass and beats, ambient washes, guitars, pianos, droning chords, chimes, bells, and analogue synths, spread over four epic tracks.</p>
 
<p>In summer 2015, Geisha signed with The Beauty Of Melody Recordings, and released an EP called "Pegasus Tornado". This was followed by the album "The Delirium Introduction", in November. This album sees the Geisha sound develop to include ambient house, dub, vocal tracks, and more cosmic, way-out moments.</p>
 
<p>Regarding influences, Robert says "Susumu Yokota, The Orb, Seefeel, The Beatles, Boards of Canada, Air, Miles Davis, Brian Eno and King Crimson are all artists who've influenced me, and my wish was to mix together everything I loved about them to come up with something unique that hasn't really been done before. Each track is approached in a different way and a big part of the focus is on the live instruments. It's making electronic music organically. </p>
 
<p>The sound of Geisha is truly an original one.</p>
